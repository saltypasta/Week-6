# Introduction 

## Resonances

> 1. "In recent years, calls have reached a head to decolonize museum collections—by returning heritage objects to their owners or presenting them differently" (https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/archaeology-diversity/)
+ See my response here: https://hyp.is/9HtFxDCPEeyXuS8rVyewhg/www.sapiens.org/archaeology/archaeology-diversity/


> 2. Although “chilly climate” is a rather broad concept, Wylie ([1993](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/leaky-pipeline-and-chilly-climate-in-archaeology-in-canada/B5224D9F4FDB3BAE4624A5079FB67C6A#ref82)) identified several specific factors: (1) gender stereotyping, resulting in heavier service and teaching demands; (2) devaluing of research accomplishments, resulting in women being less competitive in job searches, and if hired, lower salaries and allocation of institutional resources; and (3) sexual harassment and assault, resulting in women leaving the discipline. To this list, we might add (4) a work environment that is not family-friendly.


> 3. Finally, Kelley and Hill ([2019](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/leaky-pipeline-and-chilly-climate-in-archaeology-in-canada/B5224D9F4FDB3BAE4624A5079FB67C6A#ref46)) found that some women (but no men) who withdrew from the University of Calgary's graduate program cited family and childcare reasons. This pattern existed despite the fact that fewer women enrolled were parents (10% vs. 25%). Interestingly, Goldstein and colleagues ([2018](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/leaky-pipeline-and-chilly-climate-in-archaeology-in-canada/B5224D9F4FDB3BAE4624A5079FB67C6A#ref31)) found that although nearly all of the 36 faculty women they interviewed mentioned the challenge of balancing family responsibilities and fieldwork, most indicated that they were able to do so thanks to supportive partners and “creative childcare” (Goldstein et al. [2018](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/leaky-pipeline-and-chilly-climate-in-archaeology-in-canada/B5224D9F4FDB3BAE4624A5079FB67C6A#ref31):376–377).


> 4. Histories are all-too-often appropriated for museum exhibits and visitor centers without collaboration or consultation with descendant communities. Not only do Black and Native people remain uncompensated for their heritage, they aren’t even asked if those who took this “knowledge” got the facts right.

## Response to the Prompts

Response to resonance 4: 

This made me think of last weeks readings, and how our own "cultural baggage" changes the information we collect and portray. This speaks to the importance of diversity in archaeology, as well as why things like the [Whiteness of Archaeology](https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/archaeology-diversity/#annotations:9HtFxDCPEeyXuS8rVyewhg) are a problem.  The 4th resonance stood out to me because it demonstrated exactly how a lack of diversity manifests in the creation of history and knowledge. Ignorance will find its way into data, and it can be harmful. One example that comes to mind from my history of ancient rome class is Etruscan burial practices. For decades, we believed that the differences we see in Etruscan burial practices were due to differences in race. Now, we have evidence that it had more to do with families than race. I'm not implying necessarily that the historians who proposed race as a factor were racists (I do not remember the evidence they had so it may have been a reasonable conclusion), however its harmful to associate race with our differences as people.
